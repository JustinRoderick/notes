Supervised Learning is when we have a labeled data set with any number of input variables, (also known as independent variables or features) which are used to predict an output variable, or target. The training data from this set is used to train the model to be used to predict the output variable for new unknown data.

As the model is provided with input data, it adjusts the weights of input variables until it has been appropriately fitted. It does this through [[Gradient Descent]] and [[Backpropagation]].

The accuracy of Supervised Learning models is measured through Loss Functions. And the goal is to adjust the model to minimize the this [[Loss Function]]
## Types of Supervised Learning

- Regression: Predict a continuous numeric target variable for a given input variable. Common types are [[Linear Regression]], [[Polynomial Regression]], [[Decision Trees]], and [[Support Vector Regression]]
- Classification: Predict a discrete categorical variable known as a label or class. Can have two or more classes. Most common are: [[Logistic Regression]], [[K-Nearest Neighbors]]
