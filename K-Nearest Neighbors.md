Supervised Learning model that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems. Works by predicting the value/class for new data points by computing the average of its K nearest neighbors.

K is a [[Hyperparameters]] of the algorithm and choosing the right K is essential to creating a model that avoids [[Over-Fitting]] (Small K) and [[Under-Fitting]] (Large K)
