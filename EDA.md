## Main steps of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Provide Descriptions of your samples and features (your data). This means looking at the shape, types, and statistics of your data.
- Check for missing data. Remove null values that have high importance in training the model.
- Identify the shape of the data
- Identify significant correlations.
- Spot and deal with the outliers in the data. One way to find outliers is look at a visualization of the data. A scatterplot can be a good way to see which data points fall far from a normal standard deviation. Other more robust methods can be found: [[Outliers]]
